                <h3>1 WAFFLE FRIES <span>CHICK-FIL-A</span></h3>
                MICAH PETERS: You know the scene in Scott Pilgrim vs. the World where Scott tells Ramona that, were he
                to
                have his way, he’d eat garlic bread forever without ever having to stop? I could probably do that with
                Chick-fil-A waffle fries. Except then I'd get fat. Fries make you fat.

                <h3>2 DOUBLE-DOUBLE <span>IN-N-OUT </span></h3>
                RILEY MCATEE: There's one small change that can take the Double-Double from “best burger ever” to
                “literal
                perfection between two buns.” Ask for grilled onions—instead of the sliced onion—the next time you order
                one. It
                gets you halfway to Animal Style for free.

                <h3>3 FRIES <span> MCDONALD'S </span></h3>
                LINDSAY ZOLADZ: There is a semi-fancy bar that my friends and I like to go to, and we always order a big
                bowl of their fries because they taste like McDonald’s fries. No matter how fancy the restaurant,
                “Tastes
                like McDonald’s fries” is the highest compliment you can give a french fry. Also, no other fast-food
                item
                has a Kanye West poem written about it. “I don't trust no food that smells that good, man,” he says of
                the
                fries in “McDonald’s Man.” There is no competition; this is the most foolish thing Kanye West has ever
                said.

                <h3>4 CHICKEN <span> POPEYES </span></h3>
                K. AUSTIN COLLINS: The only bad thing about Beyoncé is that she has a lifetime of free chicken at
                Popeyes but, being a vegan, can't take advantage of it. Imagine having unfettered access to that
                succulent meat and those perfectly crisp and savory flaps of fried skin every day. OK—so some of us are
                already practically living that life. But imagine living it for free.

                HANNAH GIORGIS: The Chick-fil-A chicken sandwich is transcendent. The perfect combination of a generous
                portion of breaded chicken, soft bun, and tart pickles, it's enhanced by only one thing: Polynesian
                sauce.

                <h3> 6 CURLY FRIES <span> ARBY'S </span> </h3>
                <b>MEGAN SCHUSTER:</b> Picture some of the best things in life: grandiose spiral staircases;
                chocolate-vanilla swirl ice cream cones; Slinkies descending slowly down steps. What do they all have in
                common? Their shape. Apply that same shape to salted, deep-fried potatoes, and of course you'd end up
                with perfection in physical form: Arby's curly fries.

                <h3> 7 BLIZZARD <span> DAIRY QUEEN </span></h3>
                JACK MCCLUSKEY: Certain foods become more about who you eat them with than how they taste (or nutrition,
                of course). For me, the Dairy Queen Blizzard is about my wife, about warm summer nights, about sitting
                and chatting between delicious bites of soft serve swirled with treats (usually Oreo for me). It’s one
                of the best parts of summer.
