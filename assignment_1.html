			<p> <b>M</b>olly had been staring out of her window for about an hour now. On her desk, 
			lying between the copies of <i>Nature</i>, <i>New Scientist,</i> and all the other </br>scientific 
			journals her work had appeared in, was a well thumbed copy of <cite>On The Road </cite>. It had been Molly's favorited book since college, 
and the longer she </br>spent in these four walls the more she felt she needed to be free. </p>

			<p> She had spent the last ten years in this room, sitting under a poster with an Oscar Wilde quote proclaiming that <q>Work is the refuge of people who have </br>
nothing better to do</q>. Although many considered her pioneering work, unraveling the secrets of the llama
 <strong><abbr title="Deoxyribonucleic acid"> DNA,</strong> to be an outstanding achievement, Molly </br> <em>did </em>think she had something better to do.</P>
